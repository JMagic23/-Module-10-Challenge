Develop a Jupyter notebook tasked with clustering cryptocurrencies based on their performance across different time periods. Subsequently, visualize the results to effectively demonstrate the performance to stakeholders.

Key Tasks:

Determine the optimal value for k using the original data.
Employ K-Means to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the original dataset.
Enhance the clusters through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Identify the best value for k using the PCA-transformed data.
Cluster the cryptocurrencies utilizing K-Means with the PCA data.
Visualize and compare the outcomes.
Note: Throughout the notebook, certain sections, such as the loop and various plots, adhere to the guidelines provided in the class and reference the blackbox.ai module.
